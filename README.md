# 🚚 Order Routing Engine — AI-Powered Warehouse Selection

A full-stack logistics decision platform inspired by Amazon, Flipkart, and Blinkit. Place a customer order and the system **instantly selects the optimal warehouse** based on distance, inventory health, delivery speed, and cost — then generates an **AI-powered business explanation** of why that warehouse was chosen.

## 🔭 Overview

The **Order Routing Engine** is a full-stack web application that simulates a real-world order fulfillment pipeline. When a customer order is placed, the system:

1. **Filters** warehouses — eliminates inactive warehouses and those with insufficient inventory.
2. **Scores** remaining warehouses on four weighted factors (distance, inventory health, delivery speed, and cost) using **Min-Max normalization** so scores are always fair and relative across all candidates — no single metric dominates due to scale differences.
3. **Selects** the warehouse with the highest composite score.
4. **Reserves** inventory at the selected warehouse in real time (decrement available, increment reserved).
5. **Generates** a natural-language AI explanation (via Groq / Llama 3.1 8B Instant) of the routing decision in plain business English. Scores are never shown to the user.
6. **Persists** the full decision audit (all scores, eliminated warehouses, weights snapshot, AI explanation) to `RoutingHistory` for future review.

Each warehouse now carries its own **logistics profile** — a dispatch time (hours to start shipping), a cost rate (₹ per km), and a shipment speed (km per day) — making the routing decisions realistic and warehouse-specific rather than relying on global constants.

The platform also includes an interactive **Leaflet map** that draws a dashed polyline from the customer to the winning warehouse, a role-based **admin/manager dashboard**, and a configurable **routing weights panel** with live sliders.

## ✨ Key Features

| Category | Feature |
|---|---|
| **Two-Pass Routing** | Raw scores are first computed per warehouse, then scaled to [0,1] using Min-Max normalization so every factor is fairly weighted regardless of magnitude. |
| **Per-Warehouse Logistics** | Each warehouse has its own `dispatchTime` (hours), `costPerKm` (₹/km), and `shipmentSpeed` (km/day). Delivery and cost scores are computed from real warehouse data, not hardcoded constants. |
| **AI Explanations** | Groq SDK + Llama 3.1 8B Instant generates a concise 3-sentence, business-friendly explanation for every routing decision. Scores are explicitly hidden from the user in the prompt. |
| **Interactive Mapping** | Leaflet / React-Leaflet draws a dashed purple polyline from the customer (red pin) to the winning warehouse (green pin) with color-coded markers. |
| **Real-Time Inventory** | Inventory is reserved the exact moment an order is routed — `availableQuantity` decremented, `reservedQuantity` incremented. No double-allocations possible. |
| **Role-Based Access** | JWT-authenticated users with `admin` and `manager` roles see different sidebar items and different API permissions are enforced on the backend. |
| **Configurable Weights** | Admin can tune the four scoring weights (distance, inventory, delivery, cost) via live sliders — weights must always sum to exactly 100. |
| **Auto-Order Cron** | Optional `node-cron` job generates and routes a random order every 30 seconds to simulate live traffic. |
| **Random Order Generator** | One-click button generates and routes a random order with a random Indian customer name, coordinates, product, and quantity (1–5). |
| **Full Audit History** | Every routing decision — all candidate scores, eliminated warehouses, config weights snapshot, AI explanation — is stored and browsable in the Routing History UI. |
| **Premium Dark UI** | Material UI v9 dark theme with glassmorphism cards, backdrop blur, vibrant purple/cyan accents on a near-black background (`#0a0a0f`). |

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have:

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Node.js** | >= 18.x | Required for both client and server |
| **npm** | >= 9.x | Comes bundled with Node.js |
| **MongoDB Atlas** | — | Free tier (M0) works perfectly. You need a connection URI. |
| **Groq API Key** | — | Free at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com). Used for AI explanations. Optional — the app works gracefully without it. |
| **Git** | Any | To clone the repository |

---

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/order-routing-engine.git
cd order-routing-engine
```

### 2. Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

### 3. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `server/` directory (see the [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) section below for all keys).

### 5. Seed the Database

```bash
cd server
node seed.js
```

> This populates MongoDB with 2 users, 5 warehouses (each with unique logistics attributes), 3 products, 15 inventory records, and the default routing config.

### 6. Start the Backend

```bash
cd server
node server.js
```

> The server starts on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

### 7. Start the Frontend

Open a **new terminal**:

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

> The Vite dev server starts on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

---

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the **`server/`** directory with the following keys:

```env
# Server port (defaults to 5000 if not set; use 10000 when deploying to Render)
PORT=5000

# MongoDB Atlas connection string (include tls flags for Atlas)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/order_routing?tls=true&tlsAllowInvalidCertificates=true

# Groq API key for AI explanations (optional — skipped gracefully if missing)
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_groq_api_key_here

# JWT secret for signing tokens (use a long random string in production)
JWT_SECRET=your_long_random_jwt_secret_here

# Set to 'true' to enable the auto-order cron job (optional, default: false)
ENABLE_AUTO_ORDERS=false
```

> **Note on TLS**: The server connects to MongoDB Atlas with `tls: true` and `tlsAllowInvalidCertificates: true` in the Mongoose connection options. If you are connecting to a local MongoDB instance without TLS, you can remove those flags from `server.js`.

The frontend uses a Vite environment variable for the API base URL. It defaults to `http://localhost:5000/api`. To override it, create a `.env` in the **`client/`** directory:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

When deploying the frontend, set this to your live Render backend URL:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api
```

---

## 🌱 Database Seeding

The `seed.js` script wipes and repopulates the database with sample data for immediate testing:

```bash
cd server
node seed.js
```

### What Gets Seeded

| Collection | Count | Data |
|---|---|---|
| **Users** | 2 | `admin` / `admin123` (admin role), `manager` / `manager123` (manager role) |
| **Routing Config** | 1 | Default weights: Distance 35%, Inventory 35%, Delivery 20%, Cost 10% |
| **Warehouses** | 5 | Five major Indian city warehouses with unique logistics attributes |
| **Products** | 3 | Laptop (ELEC-LAP-001), Smartphone (ELEC-PHO-002), Headphones (ELEC-HDP-003) |
| **Inventory** | 15 | One entry per warehouse × product. Quantities range 5–50. Some set low (2, 5, 8) to trigger low-stock badges. |

### Seeded Warehouse Logistics Attributes

Each warehouse has a unique logistics profile that directly affects routing scores:

| Warehouse | City | Dispatch Time | Cost/km | Shipment Speed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mumbai Central Hub | Mumbai | 12h ⚡ fastest | ₹5/km 💰 cheapest | 220 km/day 🚀 fastest |
| Delhi NCR Depot | Delhi | 24h | ₹7/km | 200 km/day |
| Bangalore Tech Park Storage | Bangalore | 36h | ₹6/km | 180 km/day |
| Chennai Coastal Warehouse | Chennai | 48h 🐢 slowest | ₹9/km 💸 costliest | 160 km/day 🐢 slowest |
| Hyderabad Logistics Center | Hyderabad | 18h | ₹8/km | 190 km/day |

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Running `seed.js` **deletes all existing data** in the following collections before inserting fresh seed data: Warehouses, Products, Inventory, Orders, RoutingHistory, Users, RoutingConfig.

---

## ⚙️ How the Routing Engine Works

When an order is submitted, it flows through an 11-step pipeline defined in `server/services/routingEngine.js` and orchestrated by `server/services/orderService.js`:

```
1.  Order Placed (customerLat, customerLng, productId, quantity, customerName)
         ↓
2.  Query Inventory — find all inventory records for the product, populate warehouseId
         ↓
3.  Filter: Remove warehouses where activeStatus !== true  →  record as "Inactive"
         ↓
4.  Filter: Remove warehouses where availableQty < quantity  →  record as "Insufficient stock"
         ↓
5.  Pass 1 — For each eligible warehouse, compute 4 raw factor scores
         ↓
6.  Track min/max of each raw score across ALL candidates
         ↓
7.  Pass 2 — Apply Min-Max Normalization to scale each score to [0, 1]
         ↓
8.  Compute weighted finalScore per warehouse
         ↓
9.  Select the warehouse with the highest finalScore
         ↓
10. Reserve Inventory (availableQty--, reservedQty++)
         ↓
11. Generate AI Explanation (Groq / Llama 3.1 8B Instant)
         ↓
12. Persist Order (status: "assigned") + RoutingHistory to MongoDB
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

| Step | Description | Code Location |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Receive Order** | API receives `customerLat`, `customerLng`, `productId`, `quantity`, `customerName`. | `routingController.js` → `orderService.js` |
| **2. Query Inventory** | Find all inventory entries for the requested product with `warehouseId` populated. | `orderService.js` line 14 |
| **3. Filter Inactive** | Warehouses with `activeStatus !== true` are immediately eliminated. Their names are recorded with reason `"Inactive"`. | `routingEngine.js` lines 39–53 |
| **4. Filter Insufficient Stock** | Warehouses with `availableQuantity < quantity` are eliminated. Reason: `"Insufficient stock"`. | `routingEngine.js` lines 39–53 |
| **5. Raw Score Computation** | For each eligible warehouse, 4 raw factor values are computed using the warehouse's own logistics attributes. | `routingEngine.js` lines 77–117 |
| **6. Min/Max Tracking** | As raw scores are computed, global `min` and `max` per factor are tracked across all candidates. | `routingEngine.js` lines 102–110 |
| **7. Min-Max Normalization** | Each raw score is scaled to [0, 1]: `(raw - min) / (max - min)`. If all candidates tie, everyone gets `1`. | `routingEngine.js` lines 126–130 |
| **8. Weighted Score** | Normalized scores are combined with the configured weights from `RoutingConfig`. | `routingEngine.js` line 133 |
| **9. Winner Selection** | The warehouse with the highest `finalScore` is selected. | `routingEngine.js` lines 155–159 |
| **10. Reserve Inventory** | `selectedInventory.availableQuantity -= quantity`, `selectedInventory.reservedQuantity += quantity`, then saved to DB. | `orderService.js` lines 34–37 |
| **11. AI Explanation** | A detailed prompt (with all scores, metrics, rejected warehouses, and the configured weights) is sent to Groq. Returns a 3-sentence plain-English business reason. Scores are explicitly hidden from the response. | `aiExplanation.js` |
| **12. Persist** | Creates an `Order` document (status: `assigned`) and a `RoutingHistory` document containing all scores, eliminated warehouses, weights snapshot, and AI text. | `orderService.js` lines 39–81 |

---

## 🧮 Weighted Scoring Formula

The routing algorithm runs in **two passes** to ensure fair comparison across all eligible warehouses.

### Pass 1 — Raw Score Computation

For every eligible warehouse, four independent raw values are calculated:

| Factor | Raw Formula | What It Measures |
|---|---|---|
| **Distance** | `1 / (1 + distance_km)` | Inverse Haversine great-circle distance in km. Closer = higher raw value. Always between 0 and 1. |
| **Inventory Health** | `availableQty / (availableQty + reservedQty)` | Fraction of total stock that is still available. A warehouse with mostly-unreserved stock scores higher. |
| **Delivery Speed** | `1 / delivery_days` | `delivery_days = (distance_km / warehouse.shipmentSpeed) + (warehouse.dispatchTime / 24)`. Combines real transit time (distance ÷ speed) with per-warehouse dispatch overhead (hours ÷ 24). Fewer total days = higher raw value. |
| **Cost Efficiency** | `1 / (1 + cost)` | `cost = distance_km × warehouse.costPerKm`. Each warehouse has its own ₹/km rate. Lower total shipping cost = higher raw value. |

### Pass 2 — Min-Max Normalization

After all raw scores are computed, each factor is scaled relative to the field of candidates:

```
normalizedScore = (rawScore - minRaw) / (maxRaw - minRaw)
```

**Key properties:**
- The **best** warehouse on any factor always receives a normalized score of **1.0**
- The **worst** warehouse on any factor always receives a normalized score of **0.0**
- If all candidates produce **identical raw scores** for a factor (e.g., same distance), every warehouse receives **1.0** — no one is penalized for a tie

This ensures that a 1 km distance advantage doesn't inflate the distance score disproportionately relative to a 10% inventory difference.

### Final Composite Score

```
finalScore = (wDist × distScore) + (wInv × invScore) + (wDel × delScore) + (wCost × costScore)
```

Where the weights come from the `RoutingConfig` singleton:

| Factor | Default Weight |
|---|---|
| Distance | **35%** |
| Inventory Health | **35%** |
| Delivery Speed | **20%** |
| Shipping Cost | **10%** |

> **Weights are configurable** via the Routing Settings page (admin only). They are stored as a singleton document in the `RoutingConfig` collection and fetched fresh on every routing call. They must always sum to exactly 100.

---

## 🏭 Per-Warehouse Logistics Attributes

This is the key upgrade over a naive routing engine. Instead of using global constants for delivery and cost, every warehouse carries its own logistics profile stored in the `Warehouse` MongoDB document.

### Three New Fields on Every Warehouse

| Field | Unit | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dispatchTime` | Hours | 24 | How long it takes this warehouse to process and begin shipping an order after it is assigned. A warehouse with a 12h dispatch time ships 1 full day faster than one with a 36h dispatch time for the same distance. |
| `costPerKm` | ₹ per km | 5 | The per-kilometre shipping rate for this warehouse's carrier. A warehouse 500 km away charging ₹5/km costs ₹2,500. The same distance from a warehouse charging ₹9/km costs ₹4,500 — nearly twice as expensive. |
| `shipmentSpeed` | km per day | 200 | How fast the warehouse's delivery network covers distance. A package from a 220 km/day warehouse covers 440 km in 2 days. From a 160 km/day warehouse, the same 440 km takes 2.75 days. |

### How Delivery Days Are Calculated

```
transitDays   = distance_km / warehouse.shipmentSpeed
dispatchDays  = warehouse.dispatchTime / 24
delivery_days = transitDays + dispatchDays
```

**Example:** Customer in Pune (560 km from Delhi, 160 km from Mumbai)

| Warehouse | Distance | dispatchTime | shipmentSpeed | Transit Days | Dispatch Days | **Total Delivery Days** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mumbai Central Hub | 160 km | 12h | 220 km/d | 0.73 days | 0.5 days | **1.23 days** |
| Delhi NCR Depot | 560 km | 24h | 200 km/d | 2.80 days | 1.0 day | **3.80 days** |

Mumbai delivers 3× faster — this significantly boosts its delivery score.

### How Shipping Cost Is Calculated

```
cost = distance_km × warehouse.costPerKm
```

**Example:** 400 km from two different warehouses

| Warehouse | Distance | costPerKm | **Total Cost** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mumbai Central Hub | 400 km | ₹5/km | **₹2,000** |
| Chennai Coastal Warehouse | 400 km | ₹9/km | **₹3,600** |

Chennai costs 80% more for the same distance — this significantly lowers its cost score.

### Backward Compatibility

All three fields have sensible defaults in the Mongoose schema (`dispatchTime: 24`, `costPerKm: 5`, `shipmentSpeed: 200`). Any existing warehouse documents in the database that lack these fields will automatically fall back to the defaults via the `??` nullish coalescing operator in `routingEngine.js`.

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Flow

1. **Registration** — `POST /api/auth/register` creates a user. The password is hashed via a Mongoose `pre('save')` hook using `bcryptjs` with 10 salt rounds. Plain text is never stored.
2. **Login** — `POST /api/auth/login` validates credentials and returns a signed JWT with an **8-hour expiry**.
3. **Token Attachment** — The frontend Axios **request interceptor** reads `auth_user` from `localStorage` and attaches the token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every outgoing request.
4. **Token Verification** — The backend `verifyToken` middleware decodes the JWT and injects `req.user` (containing `id`, `username`, `role`) for use by downstream controllers.
5. **Auto-Logout** — The Axios **response interceptor** catches `401` and `403` errors, clears `localStorage`, and hard-redirects to `/login`.

### Middleware

| Middleware | Signature | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `verifyToken` | `(req, res, next)` | Reads `Authorization` header, decodes and verifies JWT. Returns `401 Unauthorized` on missing, expired, or tampered tokens. Injects `req.user`. |
| `requireRole` | `(...roles) => (req, res, next)` | Checks `req.user.role` against the provided allowed roles array. Returns `403 Forbidden` if the role is not in the list. Always used after `verifyToken`. |

## 🎨 Frontend Architecture

### Theme

The application uses a **custom MUI dark theme** defined in `client/src/theme.js`:

- **Background**: Near-black (`#0a0a0f`) with translucent paper surfaces (`rgba(255,255,255,0.05)`)
- **Primary**: Vibrant purple (`#7c3aed`)
- **Secondary**: Cyan (`#06b6d4`)
- **Cards**: Glassmorphism — `background: rgba(255,255,255,0.03)`, `backdropFilter: blur(10px)`, semi-transparent borders
- **Modals**: Solid opaque dark (`#13131f`) with a blurred backdrop (`blur(4px)`) — overrides translucent paper to prevent content bleed-through
- **Typography**: Inter font family
- **Buttons**: Rounded corners (`borderRadius: 8`), no text transform

### State Management

- **AuthContext** (`client/src/context/AuthContext.jsx`) — React Context manages authentication state (`user`, `login()`, `logout()`). State is persisted to `localStorage` under the key `auth_user` and rehydrated on page load/refresh.

### API Layer

- **Axios instance** (`client/src/api/axios.js`) — configured with:
  - `baseURL` pointing to `VITE_API_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:5000/api`)
  - **Request interceptor**: Reads `auth_user` from `localStorage` and attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to every request
  - **Response interceptor**: Catches `401`/`403` responses, clears `localStorage`, and hard-redirects to `/login`

### Route Protection

- **ProtectedRoute** wraps every page that requires authentication. It accepts an optional `allowedRoles` prop (e.g., `['admin']`). Unauthenticated users → redirect to `/login`. Wrong role → redirect to `/`.

### Layout

- **Persistent sidebar** (240px) with Lucide React icons. Items are filtered at render time based on `user.role`.
- **Active route highlighting**: Purple left-border accent on the active item.
- **Logout button** fixed at the bottom of the sidebar.
- **Main content area** renders the React Router `<Outlet />`.

## ⏰ Auto-Order Generation (Cron)

The server supports **automatic order generation** using `node-cron`. When enabled, a random order is generated and routed through the full pipeline every **30 seconds**.

### Enabling

Set the environment variable in `server/.env`:

```env
ENABLE_AUTO_ORDERS=true
```

### How It Works

1. A cron job runs every 30 seconds using a **6-field cron expression** (`*/30 * * * * *` — the first field is seconds).
2. Picks a random customer name from a preset list: `"Rahul Sharma"`, `"Priya Patel"`, `"Amit Kumar"`, `"Sneha Reddy"`, `"Vikram Singh"`, `"Anjali Gupta"`, `"Rohan Mehta"`, `"Kavya Nair"` — and appends a random 3-digit number.
3. Generates random latitude/longitude within India's geographic bounds (lat: 8.4–37.6, lng: 68.7–97.25).
4. Picks a random product from the database and a random quantity (1–5 units).
5. Runs the full `orderService.processAndRouteOrder()` pipeline — identical to a manual order submission.
6. Logs the result to the console: `[CRON] Auto-order: Priya Patel 742 → Mumbai Central Hub (score: 0.8214)`

### Manual Random Order

Trigger a single random order via the API:

```bash
POST /api/orders/generate-random
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
```

Or click the **"Generate Random Order"** button on the Orders page in the frontend.

## ☁️ Deploying to Render

### Step 1 — Push to GitHub

Render deploys from a Git repository:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/order-routing-engine.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Verify your `.env` file is **NOT** in the GitHub repo (it's listed in `.gitignore`).

### Step 2 — Create a Web Service on Render

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) → **New +** → **Web Service**
2. Connect your GitHub account and select the `order-routing-engine` repo
3. Configure the service:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| **Region** | Singapore (closest to India) |
| **Root Directory** | `server` ← **Critical**: Render builds from this subdirectory |
| **Runtime** | `Node` |
| **Build Command** | `npm install` |
| **Start Command** | `node server.js` |
| **Instance Type** | Free |

### Step 3 — Add Environment Variables

In the **"Environment Variables"** section, add each key manually (do NOT upload `.env`):

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | `10000` ← Render's required port on free tier |
| `MONGODB_URI` | Your full Atlas connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Your JWT secret |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Your Groq API key |
| `ENABLE_AUTO_ORDERS` | `false` |

### Step 4 — Deploy & Verify

Click **Create Web Service**. Watch the Logs tab for:
```
Connected to MongoDB
Server running on port 10000
```

Your live backend URL will be: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

Test it:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123","role":"admin"}'
```

> ⚠️ **Free Tier Spin-down**: Render's free tier spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity. The first request after wake-up takes ~30–50 seconds. Upgrade to a paid plan to prevent this.

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Integration Tests

The project includes an integration test script at `server/test_routes.js` using `mongodb-memory-server` — no real database needed.

```bash
cd server
node test_routes.js
```

### What the Tests Cover

1. **Database Setup** — Spins up an in-memory MongoDB and connects Mongoose.
2. **Express Test Server** — Starts a separate Express instance on port `5001`.
3. **Seed Test Data** — Creates 2 warehouses (Mumbai: 50 units, Delhi: 2 units), 1 product (Laptop), and inventory entries. The new warehouse logistics fields are seeded too.
4. **`GET /api/warehouses`** — Verifies the listing returns exactly 2 results.
5. **`POST /api/routing/route-order`** — Sends an order from Pune (closer to Mumbai) with `quantity: 1` and verifies:
   - `success: true`
   - A warehouse is selected
   - `allScores` array is present and non-empty
   - `eliminatedWarehouses` array is present
6. **Teardown** — Closes the test server, disconnects Mongoose, stops the in-memory MongoDB.

### Manual API Testing

```bash
# 1. Login to get a token
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123","role":"admin"}'

# 2. List warehouses (with new logistics attributes in response)
curl http://localhost:5000/api/warehouses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"

# 3. Route an order
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/routing/route-order \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" \
  -d '{
    "customerLat": 18.5204,
    "customerLng": 73.8567,
    "productId": "<product_id>",
    "quantity": 1,
    "customerName": "Test User"
  }'
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| **`Failed to connect to MongoDB`** | Verify your `MONGODB_URI` in `server/.env`. Ensure your machine's IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas under Network Access → Add IP Address. |
| **`AI explanation skipped because GROQ_API_KEY is not set`** | Expected if you haven't set `GROQ_API_KEY`. The app still works — routing proceeds and the explanation field returns a static message. |
| **`Token expired` or auto-logout on refresh** | JWT tokens expire after 8 hours. Simply log in again. |
| **CORS errors in browser** | The backend uses `cors()` with default settings (allows all origins). If deploying to a specific domain, add the origin to the cors config in `server.js`. |
| **`No eligible warehouses with sufficient stock found`** | The requested quantity exceeds available stock in all active warehouses. Re-run `node seed.js` to restore inventory, or manually update quantities via the Inventory page. |
| **Leaflet map tiles not loading** | Ensure you have internet access. Tiles are fetched from the OpenStreetMap CDN. |
| **Vite dev server can't reach backend** | Confirm the backend is running on port 5000. Check `VITE_API_URL` in `client/.env`. |
| **`MongoServerSelectionError: connection timed out`** | Check MongoDB Atlas cluster status. Ensure your current IP is whitelisted. You can also increase `serverSelectionTimeoutMS` in `server.js`. |
| **Modal form background is transparent** | This is caused by the MUI theme's `background.paper: rgba(255,255,255,0.05)`. The modal box is fixed with `background: '#13131f'` (solid opaque). If it regresses, check `WarehouseManagement.jsx` line ~150. |
| **Delivery days seem different each time** | Delivery days are now deterministic and physics-based: `(distance_km / shipmentSpeed) + (dispatchTime / 24)`. They are NOT random. They vary by warehouse because each warehouse has a different `shipmentSpeed` and `dispatchTime`. |
| **All warehouses have identical dispatch/cost/speed after seeding** | You likely have old warehouse documents in MongoDB that lack the new fields. Run `node seed.js` to wipe and re-seed, or manually edit each warehouse via the Warehouse Management page. |
